\section*{Acknowledgment}

First, I would like to thank Odej Kao and Sahin Albayrak for reviewing my master's
thesis .
\\\\
I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all the employees
of GapFish, especially Frank Schütz, Thomas Peikert, Robert
Aschenbrenner, Gebhard Wöstemeyer, Christiane Okamoto and Ferdinand
Bleschke. Without their continuous support and reviews, this thesis
would not have been possible. They all supported me, and we had many
constructive discussions that influenced this thesis. Special thanks
to Oliver Weyergraf for making it possible to carry out this work at
GapFish.
\\\\
I would also like to show my gratitude to Thomas Böhm. He made it
possible to evaluate my master's thesis at DIN. I thank Maik Tirock for
helping me with the DIN environment and servers.
\\\\
Finally, I thank my family for the support they gave me during
my studies at TU Berlin.
