## Introduction: complete overview

## Foundations
### The apathetic agile devops team

### Devops: a culture that drives team efficiency and software quality (historical evolution of the devops, loads of refs, how do i define devops)
#### Operation uses typical developer methods
#### Toolchains of operation and developers
#### Integration of developer and operation teams
#### Cluster management systems automate developer operations

### Agile
#### Continuous Delivery Pipeline
##### overview: commitment, continuous integration/testing, deployment
##### The evolution of deployments/continuous deployment
### Velocity and cycletime as efficiency metrics of an agile team
### MTTR and ErrorRate measures the quality of a software

#### maintenance: (software lifecycle management)
##### bugs + debugging
##### ilities
##### security
##### monitoring

### the apathic agile devops team

## Solutions
### reducing maintenance with continuous production testing
### Automated post deployment testing
### the deployer
#### architecture and how it integrates in the pipeline
#### importance for maintenance and feature deploys
#### cycle time vs. notifications

## Evaluation
### GapFish a startup company
### GapFish's traditional toolchain and teams
### team agility metrics
#### cycle time measures quality of delivery engine
#### locs/deploy measures risk
#### deploys per day measures agility
### software quality metrics
#### ErrorRate as monitoring measure for automation
#### problems in error rate measure defect and failure
#### solution a secific heuristic
### Results
#### traditional vs. new
### Lessons learned and future

## Conclusion
### theoretical/practical conclusion
### for Gapfish
