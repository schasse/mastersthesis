# Continuous Production Testing: an agile approach to small risk smoke test high quality software systems

## Foundations
### The apathetic agile devops team
### Devops: a culture that drives team efficiency and software quality
#### Operation uses typical developer methods
#### Toolchains of operation and developers
#### Integration of developer and operation teams
### Continuous Delivery Pipeline
#### commitment
#### continuous integration/testing
#### deployment
#### maintenance:
##### bugs + debugging
##### ilities
##### security
##### monitoring
### the apathic agile devops team

## Solutions
### reducing maintenance with continuous production testing
### Velocity and cycletime as efficiency metrics of an agile team
### MTTR and ErrorRate measures the quality of a software
### Cluster management systems automate developer operations
### The evolution of deployments
### Automated post deployment testing
### the deployer
#### architecture and how it integrates in the pipeline
#### cycle time vs. notifications
#### importance for maintenance and feature deploys

## Evaluation
### GapFish a startup company
### GapFish's traditional toolchain and teams
### team agility metrics
#### cycle time measures quality of delivery engine
#### locs/deploy measures risk
#### deploys per day measures agility
### software quality metrics
#### ErrorRate as monitoring measure for automation
#### problems in error rate measure defect and failure
#### solution a secific heuristic
### Results
#### traditional vs. new
### Lessons learned and future
